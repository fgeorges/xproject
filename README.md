# XProject

XProject, a project manager for XML technologies.

Documentation can be found [here](http://expath.org/modules/xproject/).


## Whatâ€™s it do?

XProject provides a command-line tool to manage a project using
XML-related technologies.  Based on simple directories conventions,
and annotations with the XML components, it can:

- build automatically EXPath packages for your project
- create a release ZIP file
- run unit tests
- generate the documentation out of the sources

It understands the following languages (but we are happy to add
support for your preferred language, if you ask loud enough to be
heard):

- XProc
- XQuery
- XSLT

For more information: `xproj help`.


## Install

### Using CXAN

```
    cxan install xproject
```

### Using XRepo

- Visit the [download
area](http://code.google.com/p/expath-pkg/downloads)
- Look for the latest file named `xproject-x.y.z.xar`  
- Install it in your package repository: `xrepo install xproject-x.y.z.xar`.


If you don't have the EXPath Repository manager, install it first from
[expath-pkg-java](https://github.com/fgeorges/expath-pkg-java).


## oXygen Plugin

An XProject plugin for oXygen also exists.  The repository is at
[xproject-oxygen](https://github.com/fgeorges/xproject-oxygen). 

You can download it from [the same place as XProject itself](http://code.google.com/p/expath-pkg/downloads). Just look
for the latest `xproject-oxygen-plugin-x.y.z.zip` file instead.
